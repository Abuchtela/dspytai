## Long Description
Dspytai is the first Uniswap powered Dapp that utilizes on-chain data to model potential price fluctuations in real-time.

We combine a browserâ€“based frontend that gives users the ability to determine price averages for any ERC20 contract through the combination of a machine learning model and the Graph. 

Dspytai also offers simple, free to use downloadable price prediction data in both text based csv format and image based png and svg formats that are extendable to an NFT.
